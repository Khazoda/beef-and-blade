**Beef & Blade can be used serverside only, and will work with vanilla clients. This has only been tested on fabric versions so far. Please report any problems/bugs to the issue tracker.**

If both server and client are running the mod, the server's config file takes priority over the client's


## What this mod does
Leather is used in a huge number of recipes in both vanilla and modded, yet is hard to reliably get early-game.

*Beef & Blade* rebalances cow drops by letting the player pick what resources they need from a cow by using different weapons.

Drop values can be fully customized in the mod's config file.

With *Beef & Blade* installed, you can still obtain cow's default drops by killing them with any other weapon/tool/method that isn't direct attacks with a sword or axe.
